# Contributing

This repository is being used for work in the [W3C Maps For HTML Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/), governed by the [W3C Community License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/). To make substantive contributions, you must join the CG. 

## Before making a pull requestâ€¦

Is it a simple fix, like a typo or an obvious code correction? Go right ahead with a PR.

If it's anything bigger, please start an issue to discuss it first.
You'll also need to join the community group and agree to the IP (intellectual property) commitments.
If you have an employer, you'll either need to get your employer to join the group or you'll need to inform the W3C that your employer doesn't have any IP claims over the work you're contributing.

If you're discussing changes to an existing use case, reference tool, or capability section, check to see if there is already a discussion issue open.

## Markup style

The main report is in the index.html file.

The report uses the [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki) specification generator,
with custom code to generate tags, support info, and cross links between use cases and capabilities.

For new use cases and capabilities, there are templates at the bottom of the document.
Copy & paste the `<section>` elements from these templates into place,
then replace the comments with the relevant content.

The report uses [semantic line breaking](https://sembr.org/):
wrap text at the end of every sentence,
and break long sentences after punctuation or other logical separations in the content.
This makes it easier to track edits using commit diffs.

Other code style notes:

- Start and end tags for paragraphs and sectioning elements go on their own line.
- Headings, definition terms, and short list items can have markup and text on the same line.
- Use explicit section elements with `id` values for headings h4 and higher.
- Leave a single empty line between sections or before an h5 heading.
- Don't indent markup for regular body text.
- Use ReSpec auto links wherever possible, especially for references.

## Collaboration

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all 
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the 
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.
